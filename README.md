A Brief History
---
According to the American Humane Association 'Every year, millions of cats and dogs are euthanized 
in our nationâ€™s animal shelters because there are more pets than there are responsible homes for 
them.' The main solution is spaying and neutering. This is the best idea for creating a compassionate
world for humanities best friends and companions. But this still leaves millions of animals 
warehoused in shelters across the country. Chronically underfunded, underfunded, and lacking in
Internet-age technology these shelters and animal rescue organizations are doing the best they
can to find forever homes for their animals.

Forever Home Finder is a tool that brings the best of open source technology to help with this
problem. The criteria for finding a family pet should not just be cuteness or breed or species. 
Adopting a pet is akin to any relationship and there are many things to consider to make sure
that relationship works out. FHF is (will be) a tool for doing that.
